    <header><h2>Walk Schedule</h2></header>
    <p>The dogs typically get walked 3 times per day. Once in the morning before we leave for work, once in the afternoon when we get home from work and again before bedtime.</p>
    <p>The first and second walks are typically longer and they can be taking the length of the street down to the last mulch area and back. The last walk before bedtime is usually just a quick one and they can be taken to the mulch area opposite the house.</p>

    <p>Everyone is seperated at bedtime as we have had a few issues between them in the past.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Millie - Sleeps in the basement with the door closed</li>
      <li>Jerry - Stays in the living room</li>
      <li>Jasmine - Sleeps in her crate in the master bedroom</li>
      <li>Max - Sleeps on the bed in the master bedroom</li>
      <li>Night lights are set to automatically come on and music is left on low.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Millie sleeps in the basement with the door closed. We also leave the Alexa Echo playing music for her. Jerry is given the run of the rest of the house.</p>
